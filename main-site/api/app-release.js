/* GET /api/app-release   the newest release of the Android app (android/)

   For its update bar (js/app-update.js) and its own updater
   (UpdateActivity.java). Cached at Vercel's edge, so GitHub sees a request
   every ten minutes however many phones ask.

     { version, apk, size, sha256, page } (api/_lib/release.js), or
     { version: null } while there is no release with an APK.

   ?v=<version> is ignored here, but makes a URL the cache hasn't seen: the
   app adds it when a "new version is out" notification is tapped, so the
   release just published is read now. */
